## Testing Input Fields
On [System Under Test (SUT) - Webpage](https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form) you can find the "Student Registration Form" section. Write tests for it. There are no written requirements available for the SUT, so just use common sense and make assumptions about expected behavior.

Be creative, try to come up with as many tests as you can. Even if it's sound silly just write it down. Try to think as Murpy in his famous law: "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong".

If you can think of something, someone somewhere will do it unintentionally. For example write a text in the number value field.

Create a spreadsheet with the columns listed below.
Fill this it with as many testcases as you can. 1 testcase usually contains multiple steps, and one feature should be covered by around 5-10 test cases.

## Columns for your spreadsheet
| Field                                 | Instruction                                                                         |

| Status                                | Status of the test, at the moment just leave it as draft.                           |
| Precondition                          | Precondition of the test. For example: Log in to xy, or Open webpage xy             |

| Estimated                             | Time	The average time it takes to complete the test. For example 5 minutes     |
| Test Script (Steps) - Step            | The step the tester should do.                                                      |
| Test Script (Steps) - Test Data       | The data the tests should use if needed.                                           |
| Test Script (Steps) - Expected Result | The expected result the tester should see. Be as specific as possible.              |
